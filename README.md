## Project Workflow
The workflow for this project is listed below:
1. Pre-processing 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Visulization
4. Feature Seletion
5. Train-Test
6. Confusion Matrix
7. Conclusion

## Training
We tried **Four** Machine Learning Models and evaluated their performance with our Dataset. 


The models are listed with their training accuracy below:
> 1. **Decision Tree**: Mean accuracy = 0.**954974** & Std accuracy is **0.020103**
> 2. **Support Vector Machine**: Mean accuracy = **0.971386** & Std accuracy = **0.013512**
> 3. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Mean accuracy = **0.963223** & Std accuracy = **0.025463**
> 4. **KNN', K-Nearest Neighbors:** Mean accuracy = **0.969345** & Std accuracy = **0.016428**

## Test Result
Training shows that the Support Vector Machine model has the highest training accuracy. So we further tested our test dataset with **SVC** and the Test Accuracy was **0.9714285714285714** (97.14%)


## Random Testing

We provided a list of numbers as an input for nine features and it accurately predicted the class for breast cancer.

## Confusion Matrix
Confusion Matrix from our Validation is:\

## Conclusion

We had Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database having 699 records in 11 columns for attributes. 

Attributes from column indices 2 through 10 have been used to represent instances.
* Each instance has one of 2 possible classes: benign or malignant.
* These classes was included as attribute at column index 11

Class distribution was:
1. _Benign: 458 (65.5%)_
2. _Malignant: 241 (34.5%)_

After processing data and obtaining analysis from it, we split the dataset into train-test of **70%-30%**. we trained four models. By far, **SVM** model had highest accuracy for training and test data.
